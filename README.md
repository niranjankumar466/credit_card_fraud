# credit_card_fraud
In this project I tried the create the machine learning model for detect the credit card fraud detection.

# Whcih library is required.
1.pandas
2.numpy
3.matpotlib
4.seaborn
5.using imblearn import NearMiss
6.Train_test_split
7.Random Forest
8.Randomized SearchCV
9.Pickle.
10.Joblib.

# What I did in this project.

I load the data from kaggle and it is very good data to example of imbalance data. There is not any nan value and it already have done PCA which the value  look like in point and somee negative values.
I used the this data and using the imblearn create the another under sampling dataset. After that I have used the Random Forest and randomized search CV and the model with 97% accuracy and sae the model.
